plume-rl
==============================

Solve odor plume navigation problems with RL.

### Notes
The jupyter notebook `notebooks/basic_q_learning.ipynb` shows how to train a basic plume-navigating agent.
It's a good place to start to see the methods of the environment class (based on openAI Gym environments).

### To Do
The current implementation is very basic. On a technical side, it would be good to add:
* the ability to run multiple agent simulations in parallel on the same plume
* turn the training regime into a function
* add other training approaches (parameterize a continuous function from states/actions to values, for example)
* add other plume movies and simulations

On the non-technical side
* what if agent orients its sensors?
* what if agent has an orientation that is updated with a turning-based action space?
* where are gradients vs motions especially useful?
* how to perform well across diverse plume types?
* incorporate odor hit frequency and intermittency
* action and stimulus history more broadly (may require a deep RL approach if the state space grows)
